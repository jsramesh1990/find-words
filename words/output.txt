hello
i
was
not
able
to
find
a
c
language
programming
example
or
library
for
reading
temperature
and
humidity
values
from
ti
hdc
sensor
via
ic
when
using
stm
mcu
i
use
cubeide
environment
as
i
understand
hdc
and
hdc
could
be
programmed
identically
according
to
their
datasheets
and
application
report
httpswwwticomlitansnaasnaapdfts
i
am
new
to
this
so
application
report
did
not
help
i
found
an
example
only
for
hdc
which
i
assume
has
different
application
requirements
i
would
appreciate
it
if
you
could
share
any
example
or
library
in
c
language
for
reading
temperature
and
humidity
values
using
such
sensor
with
me

hello
we
have
some
basic
c
code
on
sysconfig
for
the
hdc
as
well
as
the
hdc
you
can
configure
the

and
look
at
the
equivalent
c

on
the
side
please

hi
imantas
it
looks
like
the
error
is
indicating
the
compiled
code
doesnt
fit
in
your
mcus
flash
memory
the
smallest
stm
i
found
has
kb
of
flash
and
im
able
to
test
this
hdc
code
in
a
msp
with
the
same
amount
of
flash
this
is
generic
c
code
that
hasnt
been
optimized
for
any
platform
it
would
seem
you
need
to
clean
or
optimize
other
aspects
of
your
project
or
use
an
stm
with
more
flash
note
that
this
hdc
software
does
require
division
and
multiplication
of
float
data
type
which
can
be
messy
for
an
mcu
its
best
if
your
mcu
has
a
hardware
multiplier
available
it
may
be
possible
to
optimize
other
aspects
of
this
software
but
the
hdc
is
going
to
require
float
multiplication
to
convert
its
output
format
to
temperature
in
celsius
and
relative
humidity
in
percent

hi
imantas
slight
correction
there
are
functions
in
the
hdc
code
that
perform
the
conversion
without
the
use
of
float
data
type
you
can
remove
the
float
functions
from
hdcc
if
you
dont
wish
to
use
them
removing
them
saved
me
kb
and
my
binary
was
kb
without
them

hello
did
you
just
remove
float
hdchumtofloatrelativeuintt
x
and
float
hdctemptofloatcelsiusuintt
x
functions
from
hdcc
for
some
reason
it
did
not
reduce
flash
overflow
also
i
noticed
that
mcuc
which
i
downloaded
from
sysconfig
has
empty
ic
and
delay
functions
could
you
share
any
examples
of
these
functions
in
c
language
when
using
hdcx
sensor
in
my
case
mcu
is
stm
which
has
only
kb

you
can
remove
the
two
functions
that
usereturn
float
datatype
in
hdcc
and
hdch
if
you
do
that
you
need
to
make
sure
your
mainc
or
equivalent
doesnt
call
these
functions
you
can
also
remove
the
two
float
variables
at
the
top
of
mainc
if
youre
using
our
mainc
the
functions
are
intentionally
blank
because
were
not
able
to
support
specific
platforms
the
user
must
fill
out
the
functions
for
their
platform
this
code
was
tested
on
msp
where
i
have
code
for
those
functions
on
msp
the
complete
working
example
compiles
to
only
kb
you
should
be
able
to
run
the
example
on
your
mcu
with
kb
flash
even
without
removing
the
float
functions

the
